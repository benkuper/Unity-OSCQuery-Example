# Kudos and mentions

This library embeds few other libraries to work :
- The very useful JSONObject library from Defective Studio (It will be removed from the package when this library becomes itself a Package and I can link to it as a package dependency) : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-object-710
- A modified version of UnityOSC from jorge garcia : https://github.com/jorgegarcia/UnityOSC
